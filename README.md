# Trying out the Prisma ORM

This project is a simple follow through of the official Prisma DOCS [Getting Started](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgres)

## My experience with it

I really liked how you configure the connection, create schemas and generate migrations, but would really like support for Yarn Berry
